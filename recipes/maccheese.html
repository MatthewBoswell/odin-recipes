    We love macaroni and cheese in all forms at our house: from scratch on the stovetop, baked in the oven with a crown of buttery breadcrumbs, and especially from a box mix. Those little orange or blue boxes have been my friends since I was a kid. They represented simple, comforting meals I could make myself. Ditto the years I spent as a clueless adult making my way in the world. Before our daughter was born, about once a week her dad and I gloriously slummed it on Trader Joe’s classic macaroni and cheese enriched with cut-up hot dogs and frozen peas.

<p>
    Now my daughter’s the one who consumes boxed macaroni and cheese as if it were its own food group. I wanted to wrangle a little more control over what goes into it, so I developed my own. We’re delighted with the results and I think you will be, too. All you need for the “box” are three ingredients, and then–just like with the legit kind–you add milk and/or butter when it’s time to prepare it.

<h3>Ingrediants</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (6 ounces/170g) dry macaroni, shells, or other smaller pasta shape</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons (20g) cheddar cheese powder, orange or white</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon tapioca starch, optional</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons milk, any kind</li>
    <li>1 to 2 tablespoons butter (if using salted, reduce the salt a bit)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        Put a medium saucepan with 6 cups of water on the stove. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.
    </li>
    <li>
        Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the cheese powder, tapioca starch (if using), and salt together with a fork or small whisk. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the water is at a full rolling boil, add the pasta. Stir once. When the water returns to a boil, reduce the heat so the water is at a robust boil but does not boil over. Cook until the pasta is done to your liking, about 8 minutes.
    </li>

            Reduce the heat to medium-low and return the hot, empty pot to the burner. Add the butter and melt. Stir in the milk and all of the cheese powder mix. Stir until the lumps mostly disappear and the sauce is creamy and thickens a bit. Add the hot drained pasta and stir until well-coated. Serve immediately.

            Refrigerate leftover macaroni and cheese in an airtight container for up to 4 days. For creamier leftovers, add a splash more water when you reheat it in the microwave. I like mine straight from the fridge.
