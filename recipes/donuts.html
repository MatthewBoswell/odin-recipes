    Few things are better than that first bite of a perfectly fluffy donut. Then, there’s the sensation of making your own. From the yeasty aroma of proofed dough wafting through the kitchen to the smell of freshly fried donuts, it’ll transport you to your favorite local bakery. 
</p>
<p>
    The best part? Making donuts is mostly hands-off. You can spend the bulk of this recipe flipping through a book or binging the latest TV show while you wait for your dough to rise. 
</p>
<p>
    Am I saying you’ll never buy a “hot now” donut from the store again? Nope. But you’ll sure taste the difference and have a blast experimenting with your favorite flavors at home. Plus, this is a great opportunity to get the kids involved (pre-frying) helping with kneading and shaping the dough. Once the fry station is all packed up, the kiddos can put their artistic eye to the test with different glazes and decorations.

    Whether you’re team frosted, powdered, or sugared, you’ll find joy in making this homemade donut recipe your own. Happy frying!

<h3>Ingrediants</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk, lukewarm (110°F to 115°F)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>4 1/2 cups (540g) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled for 10 minutes</li>
    <li>2 quarts neutral oil (like canola or vegetable oil), for frying, plus more for greasing the bowl</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Whisk together the lukewarm milk, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Set aside until foamy, about 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Add the frothy yeast mixture along with the eggs and butter. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Mix on medium-low speed until combined, about 1 to 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Increase the speed to medium and knead the dough for 4 more minutes. The dough will be slightly sticky and mostly clear sides of the bowl but may still stick to the bottom.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Transfer the dough to a large, lightly greased bowl, turning to coat, and cover with lightly greased plastic wrap. Place the dough in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Once proofed, punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough into a circle roughly 12 inches in diameter that is 1/2 inch thick.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use a 3-inch round cutter to cut out about 12 rounds. Use a 1-inch cutter to cut out the center holes of each donut, reserving the holes to fry. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Gather any scraps and roll them into balls about the size of the holes. Transfer the donuts to a parchment-lined baking sheet and the holes to another parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing the cut dough at least 1/2 inch apart.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cover both baking sheets with lightly greased plastic wrap. Let rise once more in a warm place for about 30 minutes. The dough is proofed when you gently touch a donut and the dough slowly bounces back.
